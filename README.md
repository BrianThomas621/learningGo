# Learning Go!

My initial forays into the Go programming language, started at the beginning of 2016. Previously (for a little more than a year) I was playing around a lot with Python. Don't get me wrong, I still like Python, but once I discovered Go, there was no going back! I think the power of Go dwarfs that of Python's.
