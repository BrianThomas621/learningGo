# Synchronizing Shared Resources

Traditional ways of synchronizing shared resources include: 

1. *Atomic Functions:* low-level locking mechanisms for access synchronization 
2. *Mutexes:* creates a "mutual exclusion" section around a section of code so that only one goroutine at a time can execute it.
