# Notes on CUDA and GO

TODO: overview of CUDA and how to call the CUDA Driver API methods/properties in Go via `#cgo` directives. 
 
CUDA is a parallel computing platform that allows developers to specify certain (parallelizable) portions of their code to be run on the GPU rather than the CPU in order to realize potentially massive performance gains. CUDA extends the C language; it is not a separate language!
